### Brief Description of Project :
Rent 4’ U is a vehicle rental app focused on the Sri Lankan community that can be 
used for renting and reserving vehicles. This is an online system that allows customers to 
view available vehicles, view user profiles, and make online bookings. Transport facilities 
are a matter of headache for those who do not have any personal transport. In any function 
like a wedding or party, vacation, house shifting, outings, business trips and many other 
situations, they feel the necessity of a vehicle to sort out their problems. So, if it is possible 
to design or develop a mobile application for availing transport whenever and wherever 
possible, then it will be beneficial for both renters and buyers. The Rent 4’ U app takes 
information from the users through filling in their details. For any online booking, 
customers should register with the system. The App enables registered customers to easily 
discover vehicles they want to rent, as well as check vehicle availability and rental prices 
via the system. Renters can add categories and vehicles to the list. They can also manage 
all the necessary functions, such as editing or removing vehicles from the list. Buyers can 
rent out vehicles under those categories, such as luxury vehicles, cars, vans, jeeps, buses, 
and lorries. Each type of vehicle has a different fixed rental fee for a day. This fixed rental 
fee includes gas, driver's fine, vehicle specifications like AC, automatic, number of seats, 
capacity, etc. But it can vary according to the number of days. A buyer can request a vehicle 
through a request form according to their budget, type of vehicle, date and time. Renters 
can view all buyer requests. If the renter can fulfill buyer requirements, they can give a 
discount to the buyers by deducting some amount of the total fee. Once a reservation has 
been made online, buyers can pay for their rental through the app by using any preferred 
payment method and entering the payment details. If the customers need to cancel the 
reservation after booking, they can do so. Also, if a buyer is satisfied with the service and 
facilities, he/she can rate and make reviews for the app.
